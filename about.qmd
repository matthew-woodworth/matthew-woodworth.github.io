Hi, I’m Matthew, an emerging water resources professional passionate about the intersection of science, sustainability, and community. With a background in Ecosystem Science and a Master’s in Water Resources, I specialize in data-driven environmental analysis, river restoration, and public engagement.

My work bridges field research and technical analysis, using tools like GIS, statistical modeling, and remote sensing to inform watershed management and conservation strategies. Whether I’m collecting data knee-deep in a stream or presenting findings to stakeholders, my goal is always the same: to support healthy ecosystems and resilient communities.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking high peaks, volunteering for trail crews, and learning from the landscapes I help protect.
